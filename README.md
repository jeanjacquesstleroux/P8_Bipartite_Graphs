## :book: Introduction

This repository contains the source code for P(8) in Bipartite Graphs, a project led by Professor Liling Ko and Jean-Jacques St. Leroux. This project aims to implement a computational methodology to determine P(8)-induced graphs.

## :rocket: Getting Started

Before using this code, make sure you have the necessary software and dependencies installed. You need **Python** installed on your system, but **MATLAB** was used for preliminary/scrap work, specifically on creating an unrelated algorithm to help understand the usage of adjacency matrices in bipartite graphs.

Within **Python**, you will need the following packages:
- NumPy
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
